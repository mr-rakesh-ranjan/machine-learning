#### A Program that Makes all the Difference
FFE finds bright and deserving students with financially constrained backgrounds who performed exceptionally well at state and national level entrance exams. Once a facilitator verifies the student’s financial need, the scholarship is awarded and their journey begins.
While the Program’s main focus is providing financial support for qualified students interested in Technology, Engineering and Medicine, FFE’s assistance extends beyond finances and includes training, mentorship and advice from a vast network of donors and alumni. This assistance is available irrespective of the applicant’s caste, community, gender or religion. The only eligibility criteria for the Program are academic performance and family income.
