## About the program
FFE’s Mentorship program is developed to enhance the employability of FFE scholars. Scholars from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds often lack the exposure and opportunities to build critical skills that make them job-ready and prepared for the future. Through the Mentorship Program, Mentors play a significant role in the lives of FFE scholars who are often First-Generation learners.
This remote program enables FFE scholars to interact in one-on-one sessions with experienced individual mentors – Engineers, Lawyers, Pharmacists, Scientists and Technologists, for a period of 4-6 months. Along with an in-house curriculum curated specially for the program, mentors also bring in their own experiences to enrich the mentorship. By inspiring and guiding FFE’s scholars, both mentees and mentors’ lives are expected to be enriched through this partnership.

## Making a Difference - Mentee Speaks! 
“Learning through someone's experience is rare and was made possible for me through FFE's Mentoring program where one-on-one Mentoring session with Industrial experts helped polish my soft skills and build my confidence level. It was an excellent learning experience where my Mentor from Lam Research covered a range of topics using a practical approach using suitable examples and pushed me to discuss them that helped me enhance my communication skills and boost my confidence. Problem Solving & Decision making and Time and Stress management were very useful topics and helped me realize importance of work life balance. Sessions on public speaking, mock interviews and presentation skills were highly beneficial during my placement drive. I am proud to say that today I am placed with Verizon as Software developer I would like to thank my Mentor, Donor and FFE for their immense support and guidance. I urge all the 3rd year scholars to enroll for FFE’s Mentoring Program to improve upon your Soft-skills and getting ready for the corporate world.”

"Enrolling in FFE’s Mentorship program during my 3rd year of engineering was one of the best decisions I took towards my career readiness. I cannot thank my Mentor, from TransUnion CIBIL, enough for his guidance and constant support throughout the Mentorship program. The sessions were very interactive, where my Mentor gave me valuable tips on how to crack job interviews, build effective resumes, and improve my soft skills to be job-ready. Valuable tips on how to integrate technical skills with non-technical skills while facing job interviews to the importance of making eye contact and body language during the Interview helped me boost my confidence. With the valuable guidance from my Mentor, FFE and my donor Transunion CIBIL’s Support & my hard work, today I'm placed with Rambus Chip Technologies, Bengaluru as a Design Verification Engineer. I highly recommend all 3rd-year scholars to take up FFE’s Mentorship program and get guidance from the best in the industry."

“Me and my mentor developed a great bond! Every session, through numerous examples my mentor pushed me to improve my communication skills. I took away some key life skills like time management, interpersonal skills, interview handling skills, and the importance of both short and long-term goals. I forever cherish this experience and Thank FFE and my Mentor, Ms. Aaliya Islam from Microsoft for it!"

The entire program is very well curated keeping in mind student’s requirements for career readiness, my favorite being Communication skills that helped me overcome my fear of communicating in English.

The guidance I got through the mentoring sessions helped me crack my placement interviews, today I'm placed with D.E. Shaw as a Quality & Test engineer.

## Mentor-Mentee sharing their mentoring journey!
“My experience with this program has been great in many ways. The recommended reading material is light on time commitment and very practical. My mentee- Yash Pipariya was very dedicated to this program. So, although sometimes there were long gaps between the sessions, we ended up connecting at least once a month. Talking to him, I realize that the uncertainties I faced during final years of my college haven’t changed much in all these years. Upcoming graduates still need a mentor(s) to guide them in different aspects. From my side, it is a satisfying feeling to realize that I can make a difference.”
