How to Deal with Spam,KB0000011,"How to Deal with Spam
Spam has increasingly become a problem on the Internet. While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam.
To reduce the amount of spam you receive:
Don't reply to spamBe careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be usedBe proactive  
Don't reply to spam
If you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:
Setting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam. If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn't check a box marked Don't send me product updates). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list. If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company's site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message. If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source, never respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.
Be careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used
Every time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.
Otherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:
Subscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated. Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site's privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others. If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address. Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed. 
Be proactive
Adjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow:
Accepting cookiesListing your name and other personal information in your browser profileFilling in form fields for you
This will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies.
Do not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about chain mail and do not forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a virus that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example), be suspicious.
Nearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it's a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others. 
Questions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)
 Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.
Most people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.
If a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail.  It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive."

"Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My
			Computer?
		",KB0000009,"Are Copyrighted Files Illegal to Have On My Computer?
Tools built to make use of the Internet easier have created special concerns for the holders of copyright. While it takes time and energy for someone to photocopy all the pages of a book, it takes scarcely any time for someone to download an album of music, a feature film, an episode of a television show, or a computer game. Sometimes, because it is easy to download copyrighted material, it is tempting to believe it is legal to do so.
But it is legal only if the material being downloaded is in the public domain, if the copyright holder has given you permission to make a copy of the material, or if you are making copies for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, scholarly or instructional purposes such that the ""fair use"" exception under federal copyright law applies. However, most contemporary music, film, television shows, computer games, and computer software are not likely to be in the public domain. Nor is it likely that downloading such materials in their entirety for entertainment purposes without permission from the rights-holder will meet the ""fair use"" criteria.
Therefore, if you do not know whether material is copyrighted or not, assume that it is, and proceed accordingly.
But what if I own legal copies of the material?
Even if you have legally obtained copies of copyrighted materials on your computer, you must be careful to protect those copies against unauthorized copying by others.
In particular, file sharing technologies such as BitTorrent, and so-called ""private"" sharing networks (to the extent you have reason to use such technologies for legitimate purposes) should be used responsibly and with great care to ensure that copyrighted materials are not being made available for copying by others not legally entitled to do so. Indeed, failure to restrict unauthorized access to copyrighted materials stored on your computer may constitute contributory infringement under federal copyright law.
What is legal to download?
Some material is in the public domain, and is available through web or file transfer sites maintained for that purpose. Some recording artists and some television studios provide streaming versions of performances for your viewing or listening.  And some performers do give permission to copy and share some of their work.
How will the rights-holder know?
The music industry, the film and television industry, and organizations representing software manufacturers and firms creating computer games, have become increasingly concerned about copyright infringement via the Internet, and have pursued the infringers - sometimes filing lawsuits against the individuals. Other kinds of copyrighted materials also are of concern.
Just as some Employees search the Internet for music, films, or other material they would like, the rights-holders or their agents often search the Internet for computers that are holding and/or distributing unauthorized copies. When rights-holders find an unauthorized copy of a work, they often file an infringement complaint with the service provider. Sometimes, they file a lawsuit. And under some circumstances, they may file criminal charges.
The Company is the service provider for its employees. Unless these complaints are addressed promptly, the Company may also be held liable for infringement. So if you use the Company network to make illegal copies, or if you fail to protect legally obtained copies on your computer, you put yourself and the Company at risk.
What happens if I get caught?
Penalties for copyright infringement include civil and criminal penalties. In general, anyone found liable for civil copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or ""statutory"" damages affixed at not less than $750 and not more than $30,000 per work infringed. For ""willful"" infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. A court can, in its discretion, also assess costs and attorney's fees. For details see Title 17, United States Code, Sections 504, 505.
Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense.
Violation of federal copyright law is also a violation of Company regulations and will be reported to appropriate disciplinary authorities. Employees may receive a warning, disciplinary probation, or other, even more serious, penalty as a result of infringement. Company policy also requires that loss of computing and network privileges be considered as part of the penalty in cases of repeated infringement.
Does IT scan my computer for illegal files?
Although most campus copyright infringement is revealed when the Company receives complaints from the rights-holder or agent, some unauthorized service of music, films, television, computer games, and proprietary software has been discovered by IT simply because of the network performance problems caused by the traffic.
In such cases, IT does not peruse files, but makes inferences which it reports to the appropriate disciplinary authority, while notifying the employee of the potential disciplinary and legal action. As a general matter, the Company is committed to protection of privacy, unless intrusion is warranted, and does not actively monitor its computing network for purposes of seeking out infringing activity on the part of its users. Further, the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it clear that the service provider is not expected to be aware of content carried through its services, only to be properly responsive when alleged infringement is reported.
Please be aware the Company cannot knowingly assist you in illegal activity, such as making unauthorized copies or sharing copyrighted materials without authorization. To do so would be to participate in violating federal law and, in acting as agents of the Company, staff are forbidden to do so.

Definitions
The term ""spam"" is Internet slang that refers to unsolicited commercial email (UCE) or unsolicited bulk email (UBE). Some people refer to this kind of communication as junk email to equate it with the paper junk mail that comes through the US Mail.

"What are phishing scams and how can I avoid them?
		",KB0000028,"Phishing explained
Phishing Explained
Phishing scams are typically fraudulent email messages appearing to come from legitimate enterprises (e.g., your company, your Internet service provider, your bank). These messages usually direct you to a spoofed web site or otherwise get you to divulge private information (e.g., passphrase, credit card, or other account updates). The perpetrators then use this private information to commit identity theft.
One type of phishing attempt is an email message stating that you are receiving it due to fraudulent activity on your account, and asking you to ""click here"" to verify your information.
Phishing scams are crude social engineering tools designed to induce panic in the reader. These scams attempt to trick recipients into responding or clicking immediately, by claiming they will lose something (e.g., email, bank account). Such a claim is always indicative of a phishing scam, as responsible companies and organizations will never take these types of actions via email.
Specific types of phishing
Phishing scams vary widely in terms of their complexity, the quality of the forgery, and the attacker's objective. Several distinct types of phishing have emerged.
Spear phishing
Phishing attacks directed at specific individuals, roles, or organizations are referred to as ""spear phishing"". Since these attacks are so pointed, attackers may go to great lengths to gather specific personal or institutional information in the hope of making the attack more believable and increasing the likelihood of its success.
The best defense against spear phishing is to carefully, securely discard information (i.e., using a cross-cut shredder) that could be used in such an attack. Further, be aware of data that may be relatively easily obtainable (e.g., your title at work, your favorite places, or where you bank), and think before acting on seemingly random requests via email or phone.
Whaling
The term ""whaling"" is used to describe phishing attacks (usually spear phishing) directed specifically at executive officers or other high-profile targets within a business, government, or other organization.
Avoiding phishing scams
The Company and other reputable organizations will never use email to request that you reply with your passphrase, Social Security number, or confidential personal information. Be suspicious of any email message that asks you to enter or verify personal information, through a web site or by replying to the message itself. Never reply to or click the links in a message. If you think the message may be legitimate, go directly to the company's web site (i.e., type the real URL into your browser) or contact the company to see if you really do need to take the action described in the email message.
When you recognize a phishing message, delete the email message from your Inbox, and then empty it from the deleted items folder to avoid accidentally accessing the web sites it points to.
Always read your email as plain text.
Phishing messages often contain clickable images that look legitimate; by reading messages in plain text, you can see the URLs that any images point to. Additionally, when you allow your mail client to read HTML or other non-text-only formatting, attackers can take advantage of your mail client's ability to execute code, which leaves your computer vulnerable to viruses, worms, and Trojans.
Warnings
Reading email as plain text is a general best practice that, while avoiding some phishing attempts, won't avoid them all. Some legitimate sites use redirect scripts that don't check the redirects. Consequently, phishing perpetrators can use these scripts to redirect from legitimate sites to their fake sites.
Another tactic is to use a homograph attack, which, due to International Domain Name (IDN) support in modern browsers, allows attackers to use different languagecharacter sets to produce URLs that look remarkably like the authentic ones.
Reporting phishing attempts
If the phishing attempt targets the Company in any way (e.g., asks for the Company's Webmail users to ""verify their accounts"", includes a malicious PDF directed to human resources, or impersonates the Company), forward it with full headers to the Company Information Security Office. You can report a phishing scam attempt to the company that is being spoofed. You can also send reports to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Depending on where you live, some local authorities also accept phishing scam reports. Finally, you can send details to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, which is building a database of common scams to which people can refer.

What is a cookie?		,KB0000007,"What is a cookie?
Cookies are messages that web servers pass to your web browser when you visit Internet sites. Your browser stores each message in a small file, called cookie.txt. When you request another page from the server, your browser sends the cookie back to the server. These files typically contain information about your visit to the web page, as well as any information you've volunteered, such as your name and interests.
Examples of cookies
Cookies are most commonly used to track web site activity. When you visit some sites, the server gives you a cookie that acts as your identification card. Upon each return visit to that site, your browser passes that cookie back to the server. In this way, a web server can gather information about which web pages are used the most, and which pages are gathering the most repeat hits.
Cookies are also used for online shopping. Online stores often use cookies that record any personal information you enter, as well as any items in your electronic shopping cart, so that you don't need to re-enter this information each time you visit the site.
Servers can use cookies to provide personalized web pages. When you select preferences at a site that uses this option, the server places the information in a cookie. When you return, the server uses the information in the cookie to create a customized page for you.
Security concerns
Only the web site that creates a cookie can read it, so other servers do not have access to your information. Additionally, web servers can use only information that you provide or choices that you make while visiting the web site as content in cookies.
Webmasters have always been able to track access to their sites, but cookies make it easier to do so. In some cases, cookies come not from the site you're visiting, but from advertising companies that manage the banner ads for a set of sites. These advertising companies can develop detailed profiles of the people who select ads across their customers' sites.
Accepting a cookie does not give a server access to your computer or any of your personal information (except for any information that you may have purposely given, as with online shopping). Also, it is not possible to execute code from a cookie, and not possible to use a cookie to deliver a virus.
How do I clear my web browser's cache, cookies, and history?

How do I quit an application that isn't responding in Mac OS X? 
In Mac OS X, you may occasionally find that applications lock up and do not respond to any commands, including Quit. When this happens, sometimes the only solution is to issue a Force Quit command. Force quitting an application will not save your latest changes, but it will often allow you to revive the misbehaving application without restarting your entire computer.
To force quit an application, from the Apple menu, choose Force Quit.... Select the misbehaving application from the list, and then click Force quit. You can also bring up this window by pressing Command-Option-Esc.
Note: You cannot quit the Finder; the only option available to you is Relaunch, which will reload the Finder.

Should I upgrade to Windows 8.x? 
Windows 8.x is designed for using touch, mouse, and keyboard together, on hardware ranging from touch-enabled tablets and laptops to PCs and all-in-one computers, including those without touch capability.  To decide whether to upgrade, consider details surrounding system requirements, versions, features related to your own use, and support at IU.
Features
Another noticeable difference is the requirement of a Microsoft account to download apps from the Windows Store and access apps such as Calendar, Mail, and Messaging. By most accounts, Windows 8.x improves performance in areas such as speed, memory management, and power efficiency, resulting in faster boot times, smaller memory footprint, and more free memory for the programs you run. Windows 8.x also suspends apps and desktop programs when a device is put into sleep mode, allowing the CPU to drop into a lower-power state for battery savings. The Task Manager and Explorer have been enhanced, allowing easier views of system resource use, and more useful and functional file management. Windows 8.x comes with improved recovery options, including restoring a device to a clean install state, or performing the equivalent of a factory reset while keeping installed apps and preferences. Both these functions can be performed from a built-in recovery menu.
 
System Requirements
Computers currently running Windows 7 should not have problems running Windows 8.x.

"Dealing with Spyware and Viruses
		",KB0000006," 
Dealing with Spyware/Adware
Spyware is the generic term for computer software that gathers information about you and your Internet surfing habits for marketing purposes; Adware refers to programs which gather information about you for marketing purposes in order to target your computer with advertisements (often in the form of pop-up windows.) These programs are often difficult to uninstall through traditional un-installation programs and will interfere with the normal performance of your computer's software and/or networking protocol.
Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses
According to Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, a computer virus is ""a computer program usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that produces copies of itself and inserts them into other programs or files, and that usually performs a malicious action (such as destroying data)"". Computer viruses are never naturally occurring; they are always man-made. Once created and released, however, their spread is not directly under human control.
Macro viruses: A macro is a piece of code that can be embedded in a data file. A macro virus is thus a virus that exists as a macro attached to a data file. In most respects, macro viruses are like all other viruses. The main difference is that they are attached to data files (i.e., documents) rather than executable programs.
Document-based viruses are, and will likely continue to be, more prevalent than any other type of virus.
Worms: Worms are very similar to viruses in that they are computer programs that replicate functional copies of themselves (usually to other computer systems via network connections) and often, but not always, contain some functionality that will interfere with the normal use of a computer or a program. Unlike viruses, however, worms exist as separate entities; they do not attach themselves to other files or programs. Because of their similarity to viruses, worms also are often referred to as viruses. Trojan horses: A Trojan horse is a program that does something undocumented which the programmer intended, but that users would not accept if they knew about it. By some definitions, a virus is a particular case of a Trojan horse, namely, one which is able to spread to other programs (i.e., it turns them into Trojans too). According to others, a virus that does not do any deliberate damage (other than merely replicating) is not a Trojan. Finally, despite the definitions, many people use the term ""Trojan"" to refer only to a non-replicating malicious program.
 
Fortunately, there are many options for prevention and the safe removal of Spyware/Adware from your computer:
Preventing Spyware / AdwareChoose programs carefully. Often free or trial programs downloaded from the Internet contain spyware/adware to fund the creators of the programs. The most common Spyware/Adware programs are installed with peer-to-peer sharing software such as Kazaa, Bearshare, and Limewire. Reading the license agreement and ""Read Me"" files of these programs will often indicate the installation of additional programs. Protect yourself by knowing your options. Some programs will allow you to customize the installation, whereas others such as Kazaa's latest version cannot be installed without Spyware/Adware.
Protect yourself by knowing that there are other dangers for users of these programs; particularly for those who do not understand how the software is structured to operate or for those who are not careful to share only files they own legally.
Do not click on unfamiliar links in pop-up windows. Spyware/Adware creators will disguise links in their pop-up windows. The safest way to close a pop-up windows is to right-click on it in your taskbar and choose Close or select the active window and use Alt + F4 on your keyboard.
Removing SpyWare / AdwareMany Spyware/Adware removal programs are free to download and use. The Solution Center has found success with a free program called Spybot, as well as Microsoft's AntiSpyWare. OIT advises that novice users request technical assistance when installing and using these programs. See ""Obtaining Technical Assistance"" below. Should you choose to use Spybot without assistance, read the directions online which remind you to back up your registry first, and then update the Spybot definition files before scanning your hard drive.

To change the scaling, select ""Page Setup"" in the file menu, and click on the ""Page"" tab. The output can be scaled by an arbitrary factor, or it can be automatically fit to one or more pages.
 
I'm getting an error when trying to open an Excel file.
Some users may get errors when opening files with macros in Excel X for Macintosh. Those whose User folders are being stored on a volume other than the startup volume are most likely to be affected. This has been affecting some people trying to submit the Excel-based academic HR forms, which are Excel-based. Deleting the preference file ""Office Registration Cache X"" often fixes the problem:
Quit any programs you have running, especially any parts of the Office suite (Excel, Word, etc.)Go to Go > Home > Library > Preferences > Microsoft.Locate the file Office Registration Cache X and drag it to the trash. (Note: Don't empty the trash just yet.)Try opening the Excel form again.If it still doesn't work, repeat steps 1-4 and then continue:Open up TextEdit (found under Go > Applications) and create a new document by pressing <command> +n.Go to File > Save As....Name the file Office Registration Cache X. (Note: Be sure to get the spelling and capitalization exactly.)Save it under Home > Library > Preferences > Microsoft.Note: There are actually two libraries: one under the user's Home and one under the Macintosh HD. Be sure to use the one under Home. The exact name of user's Home is the short name of the user's local account on their Macintosh, and it will have a house icon. You can select home by pressing command - shift -h in the Save As dialogue box.Quit TextEdit.Go back to Go > Home > Library > Preferences.Click once on Office Registration Cache X to select it, and then go to File > Get Info.Check the box for Locked.Try the file again. "

"Eclipse configuration for Android development
		",KB0000033,"Installing the Eclipse Plugin Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android Development Tools (ADT). This plugin provides a powerful, integrated environment in which to develop Android apps. It extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, build an app UI, debug your app, and export signed (or unsigned) app packages (APKs) for distribution. Note: If you have been using Eclipse with ADT, be aware that Android Studio is now the official IDE for Android, so you should migrate to Android Studio to receive all the latest IDE updates. For help moving projects, see Migrating to Android Studio.   You should install the ADT plugin only if you already have an Eclipse installation that you want to continue using. Your existing Eclipse installation must meet these requirements: Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo) or greater Note: Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) is no longer supported with the latest version of ADT. Eclipse JDT plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages)JDK 6 (JRE alone is not sufficient)Not compatible with GNU Compiler for Java (gcj) Download the ADT Plugin  To add the ADT plugin to Eclipse: Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software.Click Add, in the top-right corner.In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter ""ADT Plugin"" for the Name and the following URL for the Location: https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/ Note: The Android Developer Tools update site requires a secure connection. Make sure the update site URL you enter starts with HTTPS. Click OK.In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next.In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click Next.Read and accept the license agreements, then click Finish. If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of the software can't be established, click OK. When the installation completes, restart Eclipse. Configure the ADT Plugin  Once Eclipse restarts, you must specify the location of your Android SDK directory: In the ""Welcome to Android Development"" window that appears, select Use existing SDKs.Browse and select the location of the Android SDK directory you recently downloaded and unpacked.Click Next. Your Eclipse IDE is now set up to develop Android apps, but you need to add the latest SDK platform tools and an Android platform to your environment. To get these packages for your SDK, continue to Adding Platforms and Packages. Troubleshooting ADT Installation  If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the steps above and you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse, you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in Window (on Mac OS X, Eclipse) > Preferences > General >Network Connections. If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and manually install it: Download the ADT Plugin zip file (do not unpack it): PackageSizeMD5 ChecksumADT-23.0.6.zip103344298 bytesf64b7e50c84799f41c642218c35f1bbe Start Eclipse, then select Help > Install New Software.Click Add, in the top-right corner.In the Add Repository dialog, click Archive.Select the downloaded ADT-23.0.6.zip file and click OK.Enter ""ADT Plugin"" for the name and click OK.In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click Next.In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded.

When the installation completes, restart Eclipse. To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you will have to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions. Other install errors Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional Eclipse packages (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when installing ADT, your Eclipse installation might not include these packages. For information about how to quickly add the necessary packages to your Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic ADT Installation Error: ""requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui"". For Linux users If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse: An error occurred during provisioning.Cannot connect to keystore.JKS ...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT Plugin."
Sales Force Automation is DOWN,KB0000001," 
On Friday, January 20th, we experienced a widespread outage that affected all Zoho services. The outage started around 8:13 am Pacific Time. Zoho services started coming back online for customer use at 3:49 pm, and all services were fully restored at 6:22 pm PST. We absolutely realize how important our services are for businesses and users who rely on us; we let you down on Friday. Please accept our humblest apologies. 
 
The cause of the outage was an abrupt power failure in our state-of-the-art collocated data center facility (owned and operated by Equinix) in the Silicon Valley area, California. Equinix provides us physically secure space, highly redundant power and cooling. We get our internet connectivity from separate service providers. We own, maintain and operate the servers and the network equipment and the software. The problem was not just that the power failure happened, the problem was that it happened abruptly, with no warning whatsoever, and all our equipment went down all at once. Data centers, certainly this one, have triple, and even quadruple, redundancy in their power systems just to prevent such an abrupt power outage. The intent is that any power failure would have sufficient warning so that equipment, databases most importantly, can be shut down gracefully. In fact, the main function such data centers perform is to provide extreme redundancy in power systems, provide cooling for the equipment and provide physical security. Absolutely no warning happened prior to this incident, which is what we have asked our vendor to explain, and we hope they would be transparent with us. I do want to say that Equinix has served us well, they are a leader in this field, we have never suffered an abrupt power outage like this in 5+ years. But they do owe us and other customers in that data center an explanation for what happened on Friday. They restored power quickly, but the damage was done because of the abruptness of the outage."
