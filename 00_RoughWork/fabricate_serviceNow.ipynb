       "\"How to Deal with Spam\\nSpam\\xa0has increasingly become a problem on the Internet. While every Internet user receives some spam, email addresses posted to web sites or in newsgroups and chat rooms attract the most spam.\\nTo reduce the amount of spam you receive:\\nDon't reply to spamBe careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be usedBe proactive \\xa0\\nDon't reply to spam\\nIf you reply to spam, the spammer or the automated program on the other end will then know that your address is connected to a live person, and the spammer will then bombard you with even more spam, and circulate your address to other spammers. It is critical that you pause and think before replying to any spam. Consider the following guidelines:\\nSetting up your email account to generate automatic responses while you are away can have the unfortunate side-effect of verifying your email address to every spammer that sends you spam.\\xa0If the message appears to come from a legitimate company, the company may have obtained your email address from some transaction between you and the company. In fact, you may have inadvertently provided your email address (e.g., if you didn't check a box marked\\xa0Don't send me product updates). In these cases, it is usually safe to reply and ask to be removed from the mailing list.\\xa0If it is not a company you recognize, use your judgment. To be safe, copy and paste the link to the company's site into the browser rather than clicking it in the email message.\\xa0If the spam is clearly from a disreputable source,\\xa0never\\xa0respond. Do not follow the (probably bogus) unsubscribe directions. In most cases, if you never reply, the network of spammers will eventually decide your email address is a dud, and will stop using it as often.\\nBe careful releasing your email address, and know how it will be used\\nEvery time you communicate on the Internet or browse a web site, there are opportunities for spammers to intercept your communications to obtain your email address and other personal information.\\nOtherwise reputable companies may sell or exchange your email address with other companies, and this information may eventually find its way to a spammer. At worst, spammers will use automated programs to bombard these lists of email addresses with spam. Consider the following guidelines:\\nSubscribe only to essential discussion lists, and ensure that they are moderated.\\xa0Think twice before offering your email address to a web site. You may wish to check the site's privacy policy first to be sure it uses secure technology, and that the company does not share your email address with others.\\xa0If you need to list email addresses on your web site, present the addresses in a way that makes them less vulnerable to collection and abuse by spammers.Every time you are asked for your email address verbally or on paper, think carefully about whether or not you want to receive any information from that company or organization. It is usually best to decline to provide your email address.\\xa0Whenever possible, advocate that organizations you are involved in or do business with default to the opt-in model. This requires you to specifically request to be added to their email lists, rather than the opt-out model, where they add you to email lists automatically, and then give you the option of asking to be removed.\\xa0\\nBe proactive\\nAdjusting the security settings in your web browser is a good preventive measure. For a higher level of security, have your browser disallow:\\nAccepting cookiesListing your name and other personal information in your browser profileFilling in form fields for you\\nThis will help reduce the amount of personal information transmitted to sites at the expense of full functionality, since many legitimate web sites require you to accept cookies.\\nDo not contribute to the spam problem by producing any of it yourself! In particular, learn about\\xa0chain mail\\xa0and\\xa0do not\\xa0forward chain mail to others. Also, if you receive an email message that appears to warn of some horrible thing happening (a\\xa0virus\\xa0that reportedly deletes all your files, for example) or is a touching sob story (about helping to save a poor sick girl or boy, for example),\\xa0be suspicious.\\nNearly every instance of chain mail is a hoax. The message may even come from someone you know and respect who is simply not aware that it's a hoax. Learn about hoaxes and the sites available to verify hoaxes, and do not forward them to others.\\xa0\\nQuestions regarding X-rated spam (unsolicited mass e-mail)\\n\\xa0Some members of the Company have at times expressed concern to IT regarding their own accountability for unsolicited e-mail of a sexual nature sent to their Company e-mail address. In some cases, an employee worries that a supervisor or co-worker might think the employee solicited the mail. In other cases, the person fears that an IT employee asked to assist with the computer might think the person had solicited the sexually-oriented mail.\\nMost people who either have experienced spam or have read about spam understand that spammers do not wait to be asked; they are in the business of aggressive marketing. Many spammers are deceitful, trying to fool people into opening their unwanted e-mail by pretending to be someone else or using a subject line which fools the recipient into opening the mail. Sometimes they claim falsely that the person is receiving the e-mail because the person asked for it, or expressed interest in material of a similar nature. The truth is that few people welcome spam and even fewer ask for it.\\nIf a supervisor or co-worker thinks otherwise, IT can reassure them. Certainly, IT technicians and consultants understand that spam is a plague and not something invited by the recipient. As extra protection, depending upon how you receive your e-mail on campus, there are ways to quarantine spam and/or filter your incoming e-mail. \\xa0It is advisable to immediately delete any such emails you receive.\""
